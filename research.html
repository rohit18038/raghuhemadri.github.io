							&emsp; Low-rank plus sparse matrix decomposition (LSD) is an important problem in computer
							vision and machine learning. It has
							been solved using convex relaxations of the matrix rank and `0-pseudo-norm, which are the
							nuclear norm and `1-norm, respectively.
							Convex approximations are known to result in biased estimates, to overcome which, nonconvex
							regularizers such as weighted
							nuclear-norm minimization and<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> weighted Schatten
								p-norm minimization have been proposed. However, works employing these
								regularizers have used heuristic weight-selection strategies. We propose weighted
								minimax-concave penalty (WMCP) as the
								nonconvex regularizer and show that it admits an equivalent representation that enables
								weight adaptation. Similarly, an equivalent
								representation to the weighted matrix gamma norm (WMGN) enables weight adaptation for
								the low-rank part. The optimization
								algorithms are based on the alternating direction method of multipliers technique. We
								show that the optimization frameworks relying on
								the two penalties, WMCP and WMGN, coupled with a novel iterative weight update strategy,
								result in accurate low-rank plus sparse
								matrix decomposition. The algorithms are also shown to satisfy descent properties and
								convergence guarantees. On the applications

								Simulation experiments and validations on
								standard datasets show that the proposed techniques outperform the benchmark
								techniques.</span></p>

							&emsp; Human child trafficking has become a global epidemic with over 10 million children
							forced into labor or prostitution. Children kidnapped from poverty-stricken
							sections of India have been especially vulnerable due to the lack of initiative from law

								change drastically over short periods making it hard to recognize them using these

								makes it difficult to identify these children. In this paper, we propose the ChildrEN
								SafEty and Retrieval (CENSER) system that is being used by non-profit organizations in
								India to
								retrieve abducted children from brothels. The CENSER system encodes the input image of a
								child using the proposed Memory Augmented ScatterNet ResNet Hybrid (MSRHN)

								databases to establish the child’s identity. The MSRHN network is pre-trained on the

								to learn new faces of children in one-shot using the memory buffer. The performance
								of the proposed model is compared with several state-of-the-art methods.</span></p>

							<h2>Performance Analysis of Weighted Low Rank Model with Sparse Image Histograms for Face Recognition Under Low-level Illumination and Occlusion<i

							&emsp; In a broad range of computer vision applications, the purpose of Low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) models
is to recover the underlying low-rank matrix from its degraded observation. The latest LRMA methods - Robust Principal
Component Analysis (RPCA) resort to using the nuclear norm minimization (NNM) as a convex relaxation of the non -convex
rank minimization. However,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">  NNM tends to over-shrink the rank components and treats the different rank components equally,
limiting its flexibility in practical applications. We use a more flexible model, namely the Weighted Schatten p -Norm
Minimization (WSNM), to generalize the NNM to the Schatten p-norm minimization with weights assigned to different singular
values. The proposed WSNM not only gives a better approximation to the original low -rank assumption but also considers the
importance of different rank components. In this paper, a comparison of the low-rank recovery performance of two LRMA
algorithms- RPCA and WSNM is brought out on occluded human facial images. The analysis is performed on facial imag es from
the Yale database and over own database , where different facial expressions, spectacles, varying illumination account for the
facial occlusions. The paper also discusses the prominent trends observed from the experimental results performed through the
application of these algorithms. As low-rank images sometimes might fail to capture the details of a face adequately, we further
propose a novel method to use the image-histogram of the sparse images thus obtained to identify the individual in any given
image. Extensive experimental results show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that WSNM surpasses RPCA in its
performance more e ffectively by removing facial occlusions, thus giving recovered low-rank images of higher PSNR and SSIM.</span>

							&emsp; The purpose of color quantization is to reduce colors in an image with the least parody. Clustering is a popularly used method for color quantization. Color image quantization is an essential action in several applications of computer graphics and image processing. Most of the

In this paper, a color reduction hybrid algorithm is proposed by applying Jaya algorithm for clustering. We examine the act of Jaya algorithm in the pre-clustering stage and K-means in the post-clustering phase, and the limitations of both the algorithms are overcome by their combination. The algorithms are compared by MSE and PSNR values of the four images. The MSE values are lower and PSNR values are higher for the proposed algorithm. The results explain that the proposed algorithm is surpassed both the K-means clustering and Jaya algorithm clustering for color reduction method.</span>
